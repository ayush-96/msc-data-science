        "The intended learning outcome of this lab is to provide an introduction to PyTerrier as well as an illustration of some fundamental concepts in IR (this will be followed by a PyTerrier tutorial in the class).\n",
        "  - installation\n",
        "  - indexing a collection\n",
        "  - accessing an index\n",
        "  - the TerrierRetriever transformer for searching an index\n",
        "  - reformulating queries\n",
        "  - composing transformers together to make retrieval pipelines\n",

        "Pre-requisites:\n",
        " - We assume that you are confident in programming Python, including [lambda functions](https://realpython.com/python-lambda/).\n",
        " - We assume that you have completed the pre-sessional notebook, which includes a Pandas refresher.\n",
        " - We will **only be supporting notebooks on the Google Colab platform**.\n",
        " - You can also try to use your own personal machine, but if you have problems, you should resort to using Colab.\n",

Exercise 1 (assessed), builds on the learning outcomes of this lab, so it's essential you complete this Lab before starting on Exercise 1. We recommend that you complete this Lab before 1st February 2025."
