If you have signed the required user agreement (see Moodle), you would have been emailed a personal login/password to access an index for this collection via PyTerrier's get_dataset() function, using the dataset name “50pct” and your personal credentials.

        "Now, you will delve into the performance of the best retrieval model identified in Question Q2(c) using the topic distillation (“td”) topic set. Draw a query-delta bar chart (see example in Lecture 5) comparing the Average Precision (AP) performance of your system with and without query expansion - each bar represents the difference in average precision for a given query between the baseline and after applying QE for that query (i.e. “delta_AP = QE_AP - noQE_AP”). As the topic set has 75 queries, your figure should only show the queries that have delta_AP > 0.02 absolute, in order to focus on queries that have the biggest positive or negative changes. Your x-axis should be labelled with the qid and the text of the original query and your queries should be ordered as could be seen in Lecture 5 (Slide 62). Using the produced bar chart (**check the graph is readable/complete**), and the corresponding data, you should now be able to answer the corresponding questions in the Quiz.\n",
